# IO

This folder contains modules responsible for reading and writing data to and from disk. Typical responsibilities include:

- Loading simulation meshes and boundary conditions.
- Reading and writing finite element results.
- Converting simulation outputs to other formats (e.g., `.nii.gz`, `.xdmf`).
- Handling input/output file formats and path management.

Use this folder for any code that handles file access, format translation, or disk-based interactions.
