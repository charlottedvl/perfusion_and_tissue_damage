# basic_flow_solver

Running the 3D blood flow solver:

1; extract brain_meshes.tar.xz placed in the main repository

2; compute the permeability tensor with permeability_initialiser.py.
For parallel execution, use
mpirun -n #number_of_processors python3 permeability_initialiser.py
Using 4 cores execution takes typically less than 2 minutes.
Parameters are obtained from the config_permeability_initialiser.yaml file.
This script has to be executed only once.

3; compute the pressure and the velocity field using the basic_flow_solver.py.
The solver can be executed in parallel to compute the healthy perfusion field with
mpirun -n #number_of_processors python3 complex_geom_solver.py
Using 4 cores and first order finite elements, the execution is typically less than 2 minute.
Parameters are obtained from the config_basic_flow_solver.yaml file.

4; For occluded scenarios a boundary condition fiel has to be used to specify pressure/volumetric flow rate through cortical surface territories. BC_template.csv contains an example for right MCA occlusion. Similar files can be generated by running the BC_creator.py file (in serial):
python3 BC_creator.py

In the *.csv summarising the boundary conditions the cortical surface regions are numbered so that
21 - left ACA
22 - left MCA
23 - left PCA
24 - right ACA
25 - right MCA
26 - right PCA

To use the BC_template.csv, the config file has to be edited as shown in the config_basic_flow_solver_RMCAo.yaml file.
