   Thrombus transport in a human brain (courtesy of Joben Leons).

**GEMINI** is a software package that solves problems involving blood flow to the brain
in the event of *acute ischaemic stroke* in a patient. Hello.

This is part of the EU GEMINI project which seeks to create digital twins of stroke patients. 
A subset of this project is INSIST (IN-Silico trials for acute Ischaemic STroke), which seeks 
to model real-world clinical trials of the same.

.. note::

   This documentation is for the **perfusion model** of the GEMINI software.
