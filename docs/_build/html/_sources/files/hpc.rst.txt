Running on HPC
==============

The code can be run in two version: serial or parallel. In order to run in parallel, you can either use your local
machine by following this tutorial: `Running on a local machine <local.html>`_. You can also choose to use one of the supercomputer facilities that allow to run
the simulation using high performance computing (HPC). The three facilities that support the project are Crescent2,
Archer2 and Ares. More information about those three facilities are given below, abd tutorial on how to set up the
environment for each one of them.

Crescent2
---------

Crescent2 is the Cranfield University facility open to students.

A full tutorial on how to run the code on this facility is given here:

Archer2
-------

Archer2 is the UK national facility.

Ares
----

Ares is a Polish system which access has been given to GEMINI researchers.
