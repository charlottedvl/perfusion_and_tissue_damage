=====================
The perfusion project
=====================

The perfusion project is part of the **GEMINI** project, historically the **INSIST** project.

**GEMINI**, *Generation of Multi-scale Digital Twins of Ischaemic and Haemorrhagic Stroke Patients*, is a project that
aims at creating digital twins of stroke patients. It is a European project, funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
Europe research and innovation programme.

Before Gemini, the perfusion project was part of the **INSIST** project, *IN-Silico trials for acute Ischaemic STroke*,
which seeks to model real-world clinical trials of Acute Ischaemic Stroke.

Find more information about those project here:

* `GEMINI <https://dth-gemini.eu/>`_
* `INSIST <https://insist-h2020.eu/>`_

The perfusion model aims at simulating the blood flow in capillary vessel in healthy and stroke cases.
*Perfusion* refers to the amount of blood delivered to a given amount of tissue in a given time.
The associated unit is [ml/min/100g].

The GitHub repository of the project can be found `here <https://github.com/Gemini-DTH/perfusion_and_tissue_damage>`_.
